<p>Welcome to my portfolio!.. and the very first blog post!</p>

<h3>What will I be taking about here?</h3>

<p>Glad you asked! Truthfully, I'm not entirely sure yet, but that's part of the fun, right? There's a few things that I plan on covering, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>First experiences with web technologies.</li>
	<li>Useful code snippets I find/create.</li>
	<li>My development process.</li>
	<li>Current design trends.</li>
</ul>

<p>I may also write about things not related to the web from time to time.</p>

<h3>How was this blog built?</h3>

<p><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. I'm currently in the process of writing a post going over how I used Jekyll, and why I chose it over more popular platforms such as <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> (<strong>Edit</strong>: <a href="../post/jekyll-first-experience.html">Here it is!</a>).</p>
